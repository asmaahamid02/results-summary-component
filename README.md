To see how you can fetch a local JSON file see the code snippet below:

```js
fetch('./data.json')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
```

### Continued development

I will be focusing on the following points in the future:

- How to make the design responsive
- How to use custom reusable classes
